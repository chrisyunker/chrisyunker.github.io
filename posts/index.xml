      <description>Erlang Map Function    The Erlang standard lib function lists:map is a higher order function which applies a function to each element of an input list to produce an output list.
lists:map Specification
map(Fun, List1) -&amp;gt; List2 Fun = fun((A) -&amp;gt; B) List1 = [A] List2 = [B] A = B = term() Implementing Map Function    If we tried to implement this function without using the standard lib, there&amp;rsquo;s a few ways we could do it.</description>

      <description>Recursion in Erlang Bytecode    In part 1, I talked a little about how Erlang optimizes tail recursive functions, a process generally known as Tail Call Optimization (TCO). To verify this, we can compile the functions into Erlang assembler source code and take a look. Erlang assembler source is the disassembled bytecode which gets converted to a BEAM file.
The erlc compiler command has a flag (-S) to compile into Erlang assembly.</description>

      <title>Double Encoded UTF-8 Data in MySQL</title>

      <description>I recently had the misfortune of dealing with a MySQL database which got its data double UTF-8 encoded. It happened during a software deploy so my colleagues and I had to come up with a quick solution and get our database back into live service. Luckily, we were able to find a stopgap solution, and later, during the next maintenance window, we were able to fix the data for good.</description>
